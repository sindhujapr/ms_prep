insert interval vs search insert position
insert interval is to find a postion whose value is <= the target value and next value is > the target value. "search insert position" is to find a position whose value is >=
the target value and previous value is < the target value.

Convert a binary tree into a circular doubly linked list. The order of the elements in the linked list have to be the order of elements you get when you do an inorder traversal of the binary tree.

Given a list of ranges, find whether the target range is in the union of the given intervals.
e.g: Input: a list of intervals, e.g. [-10, 10], [50, 100], [0, 20] & a target range
    Output: true if target can be covered by the union of all intervals
       e.g. return true if target is [-5, 15]
             return false if target is [30,60]

counter-example: target is [0,100], intervals are [50,60],[20,30],[60,80],[0,20],[80,100],[30,50] 

Given an array where each entry can be another array, and so forth, flatten the array. [4, [3, 6, [9, 1, 9, [5, 1]]], 8] -> [4, 3, 6, 9, 1, 9, 5, 1, 8]

external sort


find the median of million rows in each of the 1000 servers.
Basically there's external sort in O(n log n), counting sort (radix sort) variation in O(n) and distributed selection algorithm in O(n).

Build a pseudorandom maze. Write a method to deep copy a graph. Given an n x n matrix of numbers, how do I find a number?
(1) I have a linked-list and a node has a digit.  For example, 1->2->4->6->8.  1 is a head and 8 is a tail.  It means the number 12,468.  I want to add 1.  Then, it should be 1->2->4->6->9.  Implement it.  what is the time complexity.

how servers are distributed for max efficiency (locality, proximity)
I forgot this exactly but - If you had a binary tree and only two functions getNumChildren() and getNthChild( n ) how ....(get duplicates or a certain node maybe) - The main point is to use recursion. Then was asked spatial and memory efficiency (Big O)
Systems Design - What happens during and after a query is being typed (autocomplete) in a search box whether the user is trying to go to a website or asking a question etc, and how do servers complete the request and what is the best (parallel) structure for the request to go through. DFS and how servers are located for proximity
Break up a string into dictionary words: Given an input string and a dictionary of words, implement a method that breaks up the input string into a space-separated string of dictionary words that a search engine might use for "Did you mean?" For example, an input of "applepie" should yield an output of "apple pie", assuming that "apple" and "pie" are in the dictionary.  Deal with the simplest cases only, where the input string can be divided only into two dictionary words.  dict = ["apple", "pie"] "applepie" -> "apple pie"

1. 求 LCA 两种情况，有parent结点跟没有parent的结点的情况都要回答。
2. search in rotated sorted array LC原题。
    decode ways LC原题。

第一面system design. 先问怎么求submatrix的和，回答说先预先计算好 (0, 0), (i, j)的和，然后可以用这个和求其它的和。以为他会顺着这个问数据大了怎么design system，结果没有，问了个跟这个题毫不相关的，怎么检测一个程序为什么慢。然后就回答先确定bottleneck是cpu, disk io, 还是 network io. 然后针对每项他都详细问怎么做。交流的过程中有时候没太明白他的问题吧。反正这一面的结果很不好，当天就给我加了另外一面system design. 最后还是挂在这一面上。

第二面coding. 先是 best time to buy and sell stock. 因为之前练过，讲了下思路就直接写了最优代码。然后他又让写返回两个index 的代码，这个时候有点慌了，因为没练过这个。。。然后慌忙中还写出了一个bug, 他提醒之后才发现的。改完后又让写另一个链表相关的题，单链表k个k个分组，反转奇数组。比如 link = 0->1->2->3->4->5->6->7, k = 3, 返回 2->1->0->3->4->5->7->6. 当时知道会写不完这个题的，所以就尽量先写构架，把一些细节用函数代替。最后把构架的代码写完了，留了一个反转单链表的函数没写，刚开始写这个函数的时候下一个面试官来了，就稍微讲了下思路。 
第三面 director. 问了下为什么来facebook, 怎么处理conflict，然后跟项目有关的技术问题。最后让写sqrt(x)二分算法的代码。

第四面 coding. 先问wildcard matching. 写了个暴力搜索的代码，问怎么优化的时候，说可以记忆化，记住中间结果。然后下一个题。 实现一个iterator, constructer传入一个二叉排序树，第一次调用next()返回最小的，第二次返回第二小的，第n次返回最大的，以后返回null. 刚开始提了几个用O(n)空间的方案，都被他否定了，问他是否需要O(1)空间时，他说不一定要是O(1), 那必然就是O(logn)了，所以就想到了思路。其实就是树的中序遍历的非递归实现。把栈存到Interator里面，next的时候改变栈的状态就好了。写完后有一个细节没考虑到，他提醒后改好了，另外constructor 和next里面用了同样逻辑的代码，也被他指出来了，他还指出了代码里面一个很小的优化。

第五面 system design. 问的是 shorten url. 因为之前准备过这个题，所以回答应该是非常好的。面试官没问我是否见过这个题，我也就没说我准备过了。
