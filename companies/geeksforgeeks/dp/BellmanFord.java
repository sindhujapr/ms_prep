 * 
 * Basic idea:
 * 1. If there is a shortest path between vertices u and v, then at most there are |V|-1
 *    vertices before reaching v. So we loop for |V|-1 times.
 * 2. After each above loop, we check each edge to see if we can relax it. So if we finish
 *    the Kth outer loop, dist[] keeps the shortest paths (from source) with at most
 *    K edges.
