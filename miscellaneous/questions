Determine the size of Java object
The intent of the interviewer is certainly Reflection, but you can serialize the object and calculate the number of bytes stored, as well.
The same approach should work for different objects and give a relative "size" which can then be compared.
The writeObject method should be overridden such that only the member variables of the object are serialized
(Since we are talking about containers). Then a bytecount would return reliable comparison results. 
This should work since all objects are custom serialized the same way,

If object is serializable, we can use ByteArrayOutputStream and ObjectOutputStream to write the object to file and then check the file size

Determine of the heap usage:
long heapSize = Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory();
long heapMaxSize = Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory();
long heapFreeSize = Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory();
